👋 Hey there! I'm a Frontend Developer who loves crafting clean, interactive, and user-friendly experiences on the web.

🧠 I'm also AI-curious — always exploring how intelligent systems can make our lives (and code) smarter.

💻 By day, I wrangle pixels and components.  
🌱 By evening, I grow veggies and ideas.  
🏃 On weekends, you’ll find me chasing kilometers.  
😺 All of this under the watchful eye of my cats supervisor.

Let’s build something cool — or at least weird enough to make us smile.
